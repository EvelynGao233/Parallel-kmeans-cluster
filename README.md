# Parallel-kmeans-cluster

## Overview

This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm in both sequential and parallelized versions using OpenMP and CUDA. K-means is a widely used clustering technique in machine learning and data analysis for partitioning data points into distinct groups based on their distances to centroids.

## The repository includes:

Sequential implementation in C

OpenMP implementation for parallelization on CPUs

CUDA implementation for parallelization on GPUs

Tools for generating synthetic 3D and 4D data points
